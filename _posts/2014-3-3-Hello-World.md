title: Week 1

Based on my past experience with Downing, I have great expectations from this class. I previously took his Object Oriented Programming class, and felt that he taught me a lot more than any of my other classes have. Although I will dread the times when he will call on me during class, I think this class will still be enjoyable. I hope that I will be more prepared now that I have some experience with him. One of the things that I will be looking forward to would be the group project. In OOP, Downing never had any group projects, only pairs at most, so I feel this will be a good experience in working with a team of colleagues.

Because I know absolutely nothing about web development, one of my concerns is struggling with learning the various tools and languages that we plan to be using during this class. Because there are so many opportunities in web development, I have always felt that my lack of experience in this field is a major weakness of mine. By taking this class, I am hoping that I will be able to overcome my weakness, and become more fluent in web development.

#### Tip of the week:
If some of you guys need a refresher for git, [JekyllNow](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) is great. You can just scroll  through real quick, and there will be a quick explanation if you notice something you forgot. If you need an even more of an explanation, you can just google it now that you know something you're not familiar with.
