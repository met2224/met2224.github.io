title: Week 2

I feel that I need to get back into the groove of a Downing class. I do not think this week was that great for me. So far, I have yet to get a perfect quiz score. I keep doing stupid stuff, like not answering in time or not answering in the correct format. I also feel that I have been slacking in term of the knowledge that I should be retaining based on the readings. I feel that Downing's quizzes are a bit different than when I took his Object Oriented Programming class; I feel that it is basic memorization is of computational stuff due to the use of TopHat. However, this was the first full week of class. After getting a better feel as to what he expects, I think I'll be able to do a lot better. I was also not abe to answer his questions that well when he called on me, so I will need to focus on his code snippets a bit more.

This week is the first time we have been assigned a programming assignment. Although I took a Downing class before, I still have to get reacquainted with some software developing tools, in addition to some new ones. One thing I am not looking forward to would be these online judges with no response as to what goes wrong with an incorrect submission. 

#### Tip of the week:
I believe that practice makes perfect, and that applies to interviewing. A good way to practice for interviews would be to try [coding problems](http://codeforces.com/) so that one can get used to the thinking process and problem solving.
