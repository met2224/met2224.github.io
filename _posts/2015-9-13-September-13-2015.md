title: Week 3
---

This week was pretty enjoyable. I really enjoyed the guest speaker who came in to talk about Bloomberg. It was fun listening to someone in the industry talk about how they got there, and what they do. I feel that the number of tools that they used were overwhelming since I did not even know how to use half of them. Hopefully, the learning curve with using all these different tools will not be too bad.

This week's quizzes seemed to be okay for me. Yet again, I have missed out on getting a perfect score, but I believe I am still doing okay. I am gradually getting used to the information that is being taught, so hopefully, things will go even better for following weeks. Although, I was behind in the readings, and was not able to finish them before the assigned completion date. I think my goal for this following week will be to get on top of my readings. Generally, I read kind of slow, so I will have to experiment with the amount of time I allocate for completing the readings.

This week was also when the first project was due. I am fairly satisfied with this project since I completed it in less time than I had anticipated. I had a couple of problem with Travis CI since it was a new tool to me, so that was a major component that increased my time of completion. I was also stuck on Sphere since I kept choosing the wrong Python language to submit my answer in. Other than these stupid mistakes, I believe everything was in order. I am just hopig I turned everything in correctly.

#### Tip of the week:
The CNS career fair is coming up soon, so I think a good way to prepare for that would be to [find out about a company](http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm). All this nformation is available for us to learn about companies, so I think we should take advantage of it in order to made an educated decision.
