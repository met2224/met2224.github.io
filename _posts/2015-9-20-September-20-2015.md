title: Week 4
---

This week was pretty normal. The questions seemed pretty standard. I am going at the same pace as the previous week, so I will need to work harder if I wanted to see any differences in grades. It seems like Professor Downing is begnning to circle back around on his list of students to call on, so one of these days, my turn to speak will come up again. In the meantime, I have a bit of time to study ahead.

I was happy to finally be done with my first project, but now the second one just got assigned. This new project seems to be a lot harder than the last project, based on what I have determined thus far, but it also seems like it would be very rewarding to obtain this kind of practice. Hopefully, I will be able to finish this project on time. I also believe it will be a lot more enjoyable this time because it is a pair programming assignment.

This upcoming week is going to be a stressful one. Because the career fair is coming up, I am bracing myself for all the questions that recruiters will be asking. I will also be fretting the various opportunities that are given for me to talk about myself. 

#### Tip of the week:
The CNS career fair is the next week, so I think that maybe there are others that are fretting about like me. There are plenty of sites that help you out when perparing for recruiting events, and [this](http://www.kegel.com/academy/getting-hired.html) is just one . I wish everyone good luck in their endeavors.
